# **Artificial Intelligence Software Recognizing Istanbul's Districts By Emirhan BULUT**
Today, I developed the 1st version of my artificial intelligence software that recognizes districts in Istanbul. I created the entire dataset with my own means and the software/algorithm was written entirely by me. The software currently only recognizes 3 districts. These are Taksim/Beyoğlu, Istanbul; Mecidiyeköy/Şişli, İstanbul and Kağıthane, İstanbul. Training accuracy is 98.45%, Test accuracy is 100.00% and Validation accuracy is 100.00%. I have uploaded the Dataset and Software to Kaggle and GitHub. I will share the article about this at Artificial Intelligence Lab on LinkedIn. Finally, the 2nd version of the software will be released by me as soon as possible.
