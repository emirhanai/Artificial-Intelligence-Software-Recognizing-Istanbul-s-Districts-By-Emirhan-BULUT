# **Artificial Intelligence Software Recognizing Istanbul's Districts By Emirhan BULUT**
V1.0
Today, I developed the 1st version of my artificial intelligence software that recognizes districts in Istanbul. I created the entire dataset with my own means and the software/algorithm was written entirely by me. The software currently only recognizes 3 districts. These are Taksim/Beyoğlu, Istanbul; Mecidiyeköy/Şişli, İstanbul and Kağıthane, İstanbul. Training accuracy is 98.45%, Test accuracy is 100.00% and Validation accuracy is 100.00%. I have uploaded the Dataset and Software to Kaggle and GitHub. I will share the article about this at Artificial Intelligence Lab on LinkedIn. Finally, the 2nd version of the software will be released by me as soon as possible.

V2.0
I am happy to announce the 2nd version of the artificial intelligence software that recognizes the districts of Istanbul with all humanity! The first version artificial intelligence software only recognized 3 districts, in addition to these, 3 more districts were added and 6 districts became recognized in the 2nd version. Added districts, respectively; Halıcıoğlu, Okmeydanı and Ayvansaray.
Test accuracy is 98.76%, Training accuracy is 100% and Validation Accuracy is 100%. We've made some headway in our goals of eliminating GPS. I will continue to develop artificial intelligence applications for smart cities, don't forget to follow me!

Thank you,
